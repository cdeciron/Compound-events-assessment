# Compound-events-assessment 
This workflow takes part in the [SusRenew project]([url](https://www.vestforsk.no/en/project/creating-sustainable-renewable-energy-futures-low-climate-risks-susrenew)) 
aiming to accompany the transition towards a more renewable energy system in Norway. 



This project aims to study climate related-hazards relevant for the renewable energy system in Norway, and specifically focuses on 3 periods:
1971-2000 (historical), 2036-2065 (mid-century) and 2071-2100 (end-centruy) Two types of compound events can be assessed: cold-dry temporally compounding events 
and low solar-low wind multivariate events. 

#**DATA**
This project uses EURO-CORDEX and ERA5 data. Global climate models - regional climate model combinations are taken from Antonini et al., 2024 and Climate in Norway 2100 report. 
Here, several climate variables are needed: tasmin,
