# Compound events relevant for the renewable energy system in Norway
This project aims to study climate related-hazards relevant for the renewable energy system in Norway, and specifically focuses on 3 periods: 1971-2000 (historical), 2036-2065 (mid-century) and 2071-2100 (end-centruy) under a RCP8.5 scenario. Two types of compound events can be assessed: cold-dry temporally compounding events and low solar-low wind multivariate events (_Zscheischler et al., 2020_). The project allows a regional study in Norway based on the 5 energy price regions. The two compound events studied are relevant for the hydro, solar and wind power sectors and aims to study events that can  impact the demand and/or the production 

# Definition of climate hazards and compound events 
## Cold-dry events
Cold-dry events are studied as temporally compounding events. The dryness of a year/month is assessed with the SPEI and the coldness of a year is assessed by comparison to the average of the time period. Dryness is assessed for 'summer' months (May, June, july, August, September) and coldness for 'winter' months (October, November, December, January, FÃ©vrier). To assess cold-dry events, the climate variables used are: tasmin, tas and pr. 

## Dark doldrums 
A low wind spell is when 100m wind speed is below 4m/s for at least 5 days. A dark spell is when surface solar radiation downwards (rsds) does not exceed 200W/m<sup>2</sup> at least twice in the day for 5 days. A dark doldrum is the co-occurence of these two events for at least 1 day in the same region. 

# Data
## Climate variables
- Daily minimum temperature (tasmin)
- Daily average 2m air temperature (tas)
- Daily mean precipitation flux (pr)
- Daily 10m wind speed (sfcwind)
- 3-hourly surface solar radiation downwards (rsds)

## Geospatial data
- Shapefile of Norway (or any other country)
- Shapefiles of Norway's energy price regions + natural protected areas

## Model combinations (GCM-RCM) used for this study
Global climate models - regional climate models were chosen according _Antonini et al., 2024_ and _Climate in Norway 2100_

## Data storage and folder structure
A .zip file is included in this project and it is crucial to download it as it follows the exact same folder structure as used in the scripts. You will find also geospatial data/shapefiles for norway and its electricity price regions. 

# Scripts
The project consists in several scripts, each being essential to assess the probability of compound events as previously described in the introduction. 

1) <ins>File loading</ins>
The script 'file loading' allows a preprocessing of the data: unit conversion, data clipping on shapefiles, regional averaging, exportation of the data as a csv file

<ins>Input:</ins> climate variables files, 2 at the same time

3) <ins>Cold-dry events</ins>
_This script allow the calculation of the probability of a compound event to occur and provides a hypotheses test to assess the significance of the obtained results_

<ins>Input</ins>: tasmin_pr CSVs

3) <ins>Dark doldrums</ins>
_This script allows the calculation of the probability of a dark doldrum to occur and provides a hypotheses test to assess the significance of the obtained results_

<ins>Input</ins>: sfcwind and rsds CSVs
