z# Compound events relevant for the renewable energy system in Norway
This project aims to study climate related-hazards relevant for the renewable energy system in Norway, and specifically focuses on 3 periods:
1971-2000 (historical), 2036-2065 (mid-century) and 2071-2100 (end-centruy). Two types of compound events can be assessed: cold-dry temporally compounding events 
and low solar-low wind multivariate events.
